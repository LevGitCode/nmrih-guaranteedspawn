# [NMRiH] Guaranteed Spawn
Grants a spawn to late-joined players who have never spawned in the current round.
Spawns are remembered so you can't exploit this by reconnecting. 

[AlliedModders thread](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=335238)

## Usage:
- Press use (default: E) while spectating a teammate to spawn next to them. 
  - Note: This option expects player collisions to be off `sv_max_separation_force 0`
- Press use (default: E) while in freecam to spawn at a checkpoint
